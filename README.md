# Project-zero C# bot develop
This repository is based on the idea from Shiroko253 and Miya253, who wanted to try creating a Cs bot.

It uses the libraries **`Discord.Net`**, **`Discord.Net.Commands`**, and **`Discord.Net.WebSocket`**.

## Purpose
In the future, it is planned to be integrated with the Python Yuyuko bot (幽幽子 bot).
